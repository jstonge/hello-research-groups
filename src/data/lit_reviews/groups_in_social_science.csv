1974,The road to agreement Subgroup pressures in small group consensus processes.," ""How do small groups of WEIRD people reach consensus.

1977,Some Effects of Proportions on Group Life Skewed Sex Ratios and Responses to Token Women," ""The importance of proportion when dominant and rare, or tokens, strategies are spreading within a group. This notion of tokens is called tokenism in socio. Drawing from Simmel, adoption of tokens depends on visibility, polarization, and assimilation. It has been fundamental in how women can take their place in traditionally male dominated space, but remained undertheorized.""

1938,Quantitative Methods in Politics-Statistical view of a perceptual world," ""Cool paper. Campbell (1958) cites Rice as a earlier reference asking ""when is an aggregate of persons an entity"", or when social units are ""real"" more generally. In the paper, Rice is noticing that known principles from perception can be used to explain why we feel that some entities, like a Jazz band, can be thought as entity. But nonetheless that the organization of the jazz band 'seems less tangible than the saxophone'.  Rice is arguing that perceiving is reality is socially constructed, so that it is not crazy to think that we can perceive groups and that groups can do things. ""

1958,"Common fate, similarity, and other indices of the status of aggregates of persons as social entities"," ""Campbell argues that, yes, 'groups are real'. He addresses Spencer's argument that the ontological status of groups---if a group is a thing--- depends on persistence, arrangement of their parts, and hence discusses how groups can be entities of varying degrees. Key elements making groups as entities are: proximity, similarity, common fate, and pregnance""

But he offers generative models to go the other way. finding groups from social networks. This is analogous to reconstructing higher order networks from networks in physics.""

This idea of circles is a key idea from [[simmel_persistence_1898|Simmel]], saying that modern society consists of loosely connected social circles of relationships. Feld complain that network analysis are carried out without concerns to those social circles. He define a _focus_ as entity around which joint activities take place, e.g. voluntary organizations, workplaces, hangouts, families... Also citing [[P. Blau]], [[Robert K. Merton]], [[Jacob L.
