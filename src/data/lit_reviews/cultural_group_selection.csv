1982,Cultural transmission and the evolution of cooperative behavior," ""Seminal early paper. B&R talk about group selection process, citing D. Campbell on ideas that some traits are shaped by group selection process. They also frame the problem in terms of public goods, citing Olson but not OStrom. There is the idea that humans shouldnt cooperate on large scale undertaking. CGS depends on rate of extinction, egoistic groups dying faster, and immigration processes. They reject genetic inheritance as being the only driving force for cultural species.""

2014,The cultural evolution of emergent group-level traits," ""Most important properties of human groups are   in fact properly defined at the level of group organization. *Yet,   most studies focus on the transmission of individual-level traits.*   This makes a difference since we cannot reduce group-level traits   to individuals (there is a qualitative difference in the types of  selection types between the two). Similar to Randall (33), there  is the argument that group-level traits are non-reducible and can  therefore only be defined at level of groups.""

Experimental studies of social preferences are reviewed, mentioning al the games we know and love. The question of scales of cooperation is nicely done too, noting how a combination of norm-based group living and psychology around cultural transmission facilitate the emergence of larger-scale undertaking among unrelated individuals. The more traditional societies literature is tied to modern stated-based societies via markers and other forms of impersonal fairness norms.""
