1992,Covenants with and without a Sword: Self-Governance Is Possible," ""Costly punishment in a repeated common-pool resource (CPR) game with the possibility to develop an individual reputation. The title refers to the idea that it is possible to have groups managing their own common pool resources without having a third party agent, like the government, who come in to intervene.""

People know when the game is about to finish, and group composition are changed randomly over the experiment. In this context, it has been shown that repeatedly with the same partners, the level of contribution declines towards zero""

They show that the extension is not straightforward, with spatial structures reducing cooperation for a wide range of params. Similar methods than [[nowak_evolutionary_1992]], no networks only CAs.""
